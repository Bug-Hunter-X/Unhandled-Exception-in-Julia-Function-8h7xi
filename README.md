# Unhandled Exception in Julia Function

This repository demonstrates an example of an unhandled exception in Julia and shows how to improve error handling.

The `bug.jl` file contains a function with basic error handling that throws an error for negative input.  The `bugSolution.jl` file shows how to improve this by returning a specific value for such inputs or using a try-catch block for more robust error handling.
